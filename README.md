# Introduction

This is my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repo for 2025.
This year I'll have fun with Python.

I'm testing [elf](https://github.com/cak/elf?tab=readme-ov-file) as a convenience script.
Here's the relevant commands:

```sh
elf input # fetch today's input
elf answer 2025 DAY PART ANSWER
elf status
elf leaderboard 2025
```
