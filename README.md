# Introduction

This is my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repo for 2025.
This year I'll have fun with Python.

I'm testing [`elf`](https://github.com/cak/elf?tab=readme-ov-file) as a convenience script.
And of course I'm using [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for tools, envs and tasks.

Some commands I find useful to document:

```sh
elf answer 2025 DAY PART ANSWER
elf status
```
